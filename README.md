# MusicIP in a Docker container.

MusicIP runs very nicely serving up mixes of your local music,
especially in conjunction with Logitech Media Server.

Although it's a very old program by now, I find it still makes 
mixes with a nice flavour, even better than Echonest in some respects,
(when that was easily available before Spotify made things difficult).

TODO:

- It would be nice to shrink the image perhaps, using alpine or a smaller debootstrap
- suexec (https://github.com/ncopa/su-exec) smaller than gosu
